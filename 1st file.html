<h2>Here the Introduction of my university:</h2>
<p>
        I study in Daffodil international University .Daffodil International University (DIU) is recognized in independent government 
        assessments as one of top graded universities in Bangladesh. The university has been founded by Daffodil Group with the approval of 
        the Ministry of Education under the Private University Act of 1992 and its amendment in 1998 and Daffodil International University 
        came into being on 24th January 2002, the University today combines impressive modern facilities and a dynamic approach to teaching 
        and research with its proud heritage of service and achievement. To be among the very best in Bangladesh which is the most challenging
        goal, has been set for the university. This has done so because it is only through working we can achieve the very highest level of 
        standards in curriculum, teaching, faculties and other activities that can realize the full potential of the academic community that
        is Daffodil International University. The vision reflects the service to the society. The mission is to pursue research, learning 
        and teaching of international distinction for the benefit of the nation. Features of the setup vision and mission are striving for
        excellence, integrity and innovation in every aspect of activity; a strong collaborative approach; open and effective communications
        and an inclusive culture based on dignity, courtesy and respect. Daffodil International University's mission is defined by its 
        IT-based traditions of service and access. The University is serving the citizens of the country through its instructions, research,
        and outreach programs and preparing Bangladesh to respond successfully to the challenges of global economy. The University has 
        proved that it provides students broad access to the institution's educational resources. (Possible suggestion: For educational
        programs in campus and beyond, the university is giving high priority on the use of new and outreach technologies available in the
        emerging information era.) The University has paid the highest priority to resource allocation to graduate and post graduate 
        education and for future development of those areas that represent the traditional strengths, quality, reputation, and uniqueness
        of the institution which continue to effectively respond to the needs of students and other constituents. Consistent with this
        commitment, the university is emphasizing on high quality education including a comprehensive general education that imparts the 
        broad knowledge, skills, and values which are essential to educate and make citizens responsible as well as to ensure specialized 
        career preparation for students. In establishing the primacy of education which is the institutional mission, the University is 
        assuring the escalating strength of its faculty with the realization that the quality of instruction is directly related to the 
        quality of the University's faculty and the commitment of the faculty to ensure excellence in educationResearch is the means through 
        which new knowledge is created and new information is developed. As such, research at Daffodil International University is an essential
        link in its three-prong mission of instruction, research and outreach. Successes among the varied research activities within each of
        its students and faculties continue to bolster Daffodil among the nation's top universities. Additionally, major efforts to increase
        the protection and commercialization of intellectual properties are central to Daffodil's continual drive for improvements in its
        committed mission.The university has been started with 67 students registering in the first batch and more than 15,000 students have
        been enrolled till date. DIU is committed to provide standard education with all sorts of facilities to the students. Since the 
        inception, the university is maintaining the commitment and it creates inspiration to the students and this is the key of the 
        continuous increasing of the number of students.
